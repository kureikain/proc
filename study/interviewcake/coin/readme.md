# Imagine you landed a new job as a cashier...

Your quirky boss found out that you're a programmer and has a weird
request about something they've been wondering for a long time.

Write a function that, given:

- an amount of money
- an array of coin denominations

computes the number of ways to make amount of money with coins of the
available denominations.

## Example:

for amount=4(4¢) and denominations=[1,2,3](1¢, 2¢ and 3¢),
your program would output 4 - the number of ways to make 4¢ with those
denominations:

```
1¢, 1¢, 1¢, 1¢
1¢, 1¢, 2¢
1¢, 3¢
2¢, 2¢
```
